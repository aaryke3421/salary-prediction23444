# Salary Prediction ðŸš€

## Overview

A machine learning application that predicts an individual's salary based on features such as years of experience, education level, job title, etc. The model is deployed via a Streamlit web app to provide interactive salary estimates.

## Features

* Trains a regression model (e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to estimate salary
* Interactive web app using Streamlit for real-time predictions
* Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and evaluation

## Dataset

* Sourced from \[Kaggle / StackOverflow Developer Survey / Custom Data] (update link accordingly)
* Contains features such as:

  * `YearsExperience`
  * `EducationLevel`
  * `JobTitle`
  * `Location`
  * `Salary` (target variable)

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Virtual environment tool (venv, conda, or Poetry)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaryke3421/salaryâ€‘prediction23444.git
cd salaryâ€‘prediction23444

# Option A: venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Option B: conda
conda create -n salary-pred python=3.10
conda activate salary-pred

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Launch the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py
```

* Visit the URL shown in the console (typically `localhost:8501`).
* Input the relevant features (e.g., experience, degree) and receive a salary estimate.
* Results include visual plots like feature importance and prediction distribution.

## Model Details

* Explored several algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
* Performed hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV.
* Selected the best-performing model based on RMSE and training time.

## Performance

* Baseline RMSE: *e.g.* 4000
* Best model (e.g., Random Forest): RMSE â‰ˆ *3500*
* Validation metrics include MAE, RMSE, RÂ²
* Visualizations of feature importances illustrate which inputs most influence salary predictions

## Example

Predict salary for an individual with:

* 5 years of experience
* Bachelor's degree
* Software Engineer role

The app would return a predicted annual salary, e.g. **â‚¹â€¯6,50,000**.
